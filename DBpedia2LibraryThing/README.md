
DBpedia-To-LibraryThing
=======================


Description
-----------

This file contains the mappings between the books in the LibraryThing dataset (available at http://www.macle.nl/tud/LT/LT.rar) to the correspondent DBpedia resources (DBpedia v3.9). 

    
The MappingDBpedia2LibraryThing.tsv mapping file is formatted one entry per line as follows (tab separated, "\t"):  
book_id	book_title	DBpedia_URI  
An example of mapping is the following:  
3123767	The Da Vinci Code	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Da_Vinci_Code  
We did not find a mapping for all the books in the dataset. We found a valid mapping for 8170 of them.
