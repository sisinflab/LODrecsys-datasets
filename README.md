LODrecsys-datasets
==================

Here, we provide mappings to DBpedia resources of items in well known datasets to evaluate recommender systems. This allows practitioners in the field to evaluate and compare their algorithms with existing approaches. 

The mapped datasets are [LastFM](LastFM/), [Movielens1M](Movielens1M/) and [LibraryThing](LibraryThing/).
You may find more information about each mapping in the relative README files. 
In particular, we mapped 10,180 out of 17,632 artists in LastFM,  3,300 out of a total of 3,883 movies in Movielens1M, and 11,694 out of 37,231 books in LibraryThing.
